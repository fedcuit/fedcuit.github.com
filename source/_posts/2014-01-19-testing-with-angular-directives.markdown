As a Java developer, I am familiar with test driven development with Java language, but for angular, I'm not, sometime it's even hard to write angular test after the implementation is done.
So I'll write a series of articles about how to test with angular, basically, I'd like to include the test strategy for directives, controllers and services, this article will begin with how to test angular directive.

Let's check out the below examples form easy to hard.
